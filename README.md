- So hands-down the easiest way to work with data inside of python is to use pandas. This library allows you to take json/excel/csv files and allows you put them inside a dataframe.

Once your done, you can take that dataframe and transfom that into whatever you want to again, similar to above. So it's super powerful and be sure to use in inside your project. To get it, you can run the command: pip install pandas to get the library
